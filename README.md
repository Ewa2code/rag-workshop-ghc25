## Next Steps & Using This Project

This example is meant to *show you the core ideas*, not just be copied as-is.  
Before using it, take a moment to:

- Read through the code and comments  
- Understand each moving part (embedding, vector store, retrieval, generation)  
- Modify it to fit your own use case

## Make It Your Own

Once it’s working, push yourself to experiment:

### Try new data sources
You don’t have to stick to text files. Try using:
- YouTube transcripts  
- Podcasts  
- Images + captions (multimodal!)

### Build something real
Instead of just running in a notebook, try turning it into:

- A tiny web app  
- A Chrome extension  
- A “search engine” over your own life notes or health data  
- A tool for your club, community, side project, or work

### Use your creativity
The goal isn’t just to follow the tutorial —  
it’s to **understand the pattern**, then build something that excites you.

happy hacking 🚀
